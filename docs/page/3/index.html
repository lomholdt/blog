    Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &ldquo;Pass the Cookie&rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!

    Final Year Project - Web Application Security Principles About 18 years ago I worked on the final year project for my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I had just gotten interested in security and was learning about security principles.
The title of the project was &ldquo;Web Application Security Principles - Designing Secure Web Based Enterprise Solutions&rdquo;.
Looking back, a really cool thing was that I had just started working at Microsoft as an Associate Development Consultant and was bold enough to send the paper last minute over to Michael Howard - who responded and indeed reviewed it!

    This post highlights a simple mitigation to improve the security posture of your organization. The idea is to, by practical means, limit attack surface and prevent spreading of automated malware, as well as limiting lateral movement by adversaries.
Network security over the last 15 years Malware can spread fast and damage businesses at scale.
SQL Slammer [1] and WannaCry [2] are two well-known cases that showed how quickly and damaging this can be.

    Excited to announce the book that I have been working on:
Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies
Learn about the foundational tactics, techniques and procedures to elevate your red teaming skills and enhance the overall security posture of your organization by leveraging homefield advantage. 
Contents and Background Red Team Strategies covers aspects that are not as commonly discussed in literature, including chapters around building and managing a pen test team.

    MITRE just updated the ATT&amp;CK Framework to include Cloud TTPs.
The update includes techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:
 Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie  It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the Pass the Cookie work referenced.

    Recently Coinbase published a well written blog post on how they were under attack. The adversaries exploite Firefox 0-days. Details can be found here. One intersting aspect is the following:
 &ldquo;We have also observed the attackers specifically target cloud services, e.g. gmail and others, via browser session token theft via direct access to browser datastores. This activity also offers the opportunity for behavior-based detection, as relatively few processes should be directly accessing those files.

    No one should beat your security team on the homefield! For several years I have been using the term Homefield Advantage in the context of running a security program, especially in regards to certain aspects of red teaming. Homefield Advantage describes well what a mature security program has to realize and leverage.
Wikipedia describes &ldquo;home advantage&rdquo; in team sports and highlights some of the benefits:
 &ldquo;This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and, in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly.

    One thing every red team should attempt early on and regularly is to perform some password spray testing across their organization to identify and help remediate usage of weak passwords.
In the past I have done this on Windows a lot, but now I built a simple version for it for Bash to run it also from a Mac.
Check it out: Bash Spray
Ideally, a script like bashspray.sh is integrated into your response pipelines, and SOC, Blue Team as well as account owner get notified - so they change their password right away, and any SOC investigation can be performed if necessary.

    Interacting with Active Directory on the Mac Did you ever have to interact with Active Directory on a MAC?
If yes, this post might be interesting for you. I am pretty new to the Mac and basic things I know how to do on Windows need some research to figure out. This time around I explore Active Directory/LDAP Server interactions.
 First, there is the Directory Utility on MacOS which can be quite useful.
