    Revisiting Cookie Crimes In 2018 mangopdf described &ldquo;Cookie Crimes&rdquo;, which is great research around Chrome&rsquo;s remote debugging feature that allows adversaries and malware to gain access to cookies quite convienently during post-exploitation.
Original research published here, and it still works today.
The new Microsoft Edge browser and Chromium Microsoft&rsquo;s latest Edge browser is based on the same code, Chromium. I guess, you already know where this is going now&hellip;

    Chrome&rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used adversarial technique - at least since 2018 when Cookie Crimes was released.
However, remote debugging also allows observing user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spying on users) and controlling the browser from a remote computer. Below screenshot shows a simulated attacker controlling the victim&rsquo;s browser and navigating to chrome://settings to inspect information:

    Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.
At times the term &ldquo;harvesting credentials&rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.
Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.

    Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.
In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.

    Announcement After countless evenings and weekends in coffee shops, and multiple vacations with the laptop, I&rsquo;m excited to announce that my first book has been published. It took 18 months from writing the first words (at Victrola Coffee Roasters on Capitol Hill by the way) to finishing this project just a few days ago.

Looking back its amazing how this all came together. The first intial draft had 100 pages, and in the end it ended up being 524 pages.

    Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this!
I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by Ada&rsquo;s Technical Books on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quarterly. A few months back I submitted an article about &ldquo;Pass the Cookie&rdquo;, so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!

    Final Year Project - Web Application Security Principles About 18 years ago I worked on the final year project for my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science. I had just gotten interested in security and was learning about security principles.
The title of the project was &ldquo;Web Application Security Principles - Designing Secure Web Based Enterprise Solutions&rdquo;.
Looking back, a really cool thing was that I had just started working at Microsoft as an Associate Development Consultant and was bold enough to send the paper last minute over to Michael Howard - who responded and indeed reviewed it!

    This post highlights a simple mitigation to improve the security posture of your organization. The idea is to, by practical means, limit attack surface and prevent spreading of automated malware, as well as limiting lateral movement by adversaries.
Network security over the last 15 years Malware can spread fast and damage businesses at scale.
SQL Slammer [1] and WannaCry [2] are two well-known cases that showed how quickly and damaging this can be.

    MITRE just updated the ATT&amp;CK Framework to include Cloud TTPs.
The update includes techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:
 Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie  It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the Pass the Cookie work referenced.
