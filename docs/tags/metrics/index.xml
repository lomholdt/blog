      <description>In this post I will discuss how using Monte Carlo simulations can be a useful tool to uplevel your red teaming skills and provide a different and fresh perspective for highlighting, discussing and presenting findings. Red teaming is about challenging an organization. This includes analyzing business processes and methodologies, including our own.
Obviously, using Monte Carlo simulations in the security realm is not my idea. I first ran across the idea in Hubbard&amp;rsquo;s book about measuring cybersecurity risk.</description>

      <title>Phishing metrics - what to track?</title>

      <description>The results of phishing campaigns are often not comparable with each other over time. Various security vendors and red teams use different tooling and techniques - which is totally fine.
However, I recommend requiring tracking a minimum set of metrics to be able to compare results over time.
Funny side facts: At times employees are messing with the red team, entering invalid creds for CISO or CEO and things along those lines.</description>
