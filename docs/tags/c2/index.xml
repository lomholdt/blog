      <description>A few years back the Blue Team of a company I was working with asked to be targeted in a Red Team Operation.
That was a really fun excercise, because Rules of Engagement commonly prevent targeting Blue Teams. Their infrastructure and systems, which are a big Achilles&amp;rsquo; heel in many organizations, are often out of scope.
Unfortunately many companies do not have adequate protection, procedures (MFA, multi-person attestation), monitoring and auditing in place in these areas.</description>
