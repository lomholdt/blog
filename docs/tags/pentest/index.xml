      <description>Application security vulnerabiltiy are some of the most rewarding ones to find. I like reviewing code for security flaws, because a lot of issues that are otherwise difficult to find are right there in front of you. And there are still plenty of vulnerabilities that auotmated static analysis does not identify, and has to be improved upon.
Race conditions are a particular interesting area, they allow an adversary to gain access to sensitive information.</description>
