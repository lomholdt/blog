      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.
At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organization at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.
Actively hunting for credential exposure The idea of credential hunting is targeted and focused, leveraging intelligence about systems and combing it with powerful search techniques to identify exposure.</description>

      <title>Post-Exploitation: Remotely observing and controlling Chrome browsing sessions (and credit card numbers)</title>

      <description>Chrome&amp;rsquo;s remote debugging feature enables malware post-exploitation to gain access to cookies. Root privileges are not required. This is a pretty well-known and commonly used red teaming technique since Cookie Crimes was released in 2018.
However, remote debugging also allows to observe user activities and sensitive personal information (aka spy on users) entirely remotely from another computer. This is what we will explore more in this post. At a high level, remote debugging is a development/test feature which, for some reason, made it into the ordinary version of Chrome that your mom and dad use.</description>

      <title>Attack Graphs - How to create and present them</title>

      <description>Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &amp;ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&amp;rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.
In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.</description>
