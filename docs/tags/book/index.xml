      <description>Adversaries are leveraging widely exposed clear text credentials to gain access to sensitive information.
At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used when red teamers emulate these attacks - which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organiztaion at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.

      <description>Conceptual Attack Graphs One question that I have gotten a few times about &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity Attacks - Red Team Strategies&amp;rdquo; is around the conceptual attack graphs in &amp;ldquo;Chapter 3, Measuring an Offensive Security Program&amp;rdquo;. Specifically, how I create them.
In this post I will briefly go over some of the reasons for creating them, and also how I create them and share a template for others to use and adjust.</description>
