      <description>There is a lot of discussion around terms such as red team, attack team, pentest, adversarial engineering or offensive security team and similar ones.
I typically stay away from the (sometimes passionate) discussions that ensue whenever this topic comes up.
Personally, I think a good strategy is to define programs and teams who operate in this space by what services the team (or teams) provide(s) to the organization.
The business groups, blue team, developers, engineers, employees and clients are the customers.</description>
