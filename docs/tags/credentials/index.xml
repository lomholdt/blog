      <description>The idea of searching or tricking victims to surrender their credentials is nothing new.
Adversaries are leveraging these techniques to gain access to sensitive information. At times the term &amp;ldquo;harvesting credentials&amp;rdquo; is used which is something that appears to be more opportunistic and I would propose that security teams start to actively hunt for credential exposure that can put their organiztaion at risk &amp;ndash; in case you are not yet doing that.</description>
