      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag &amp;ldquo;huskyai&amp;rdquo; to see related posts.
 Overview: How Husky AI was built, threat modeled and operationalized Attacks: The attacks I want to investigate, learn about, and try out  The previous post covered some neat smart fuzzing techniques to improve generation of fake husky images.
In this post we will try to figure out ways we can make a non-husky image change in ways to trick the model to return an incorrect prediction.</description>

The previous four posts explained the architecture and how Husky AI was built, threat modeled and deployed. Now itâ€™s time to start the attacks and build mitigations. The appendix in this post shows all the attacks I want to research and perform in this series over the next few weeks/months.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag &amp;ldquo;huskyai&amp;rdquo; to see all the posts, or visit the overview section.
In the previous post we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model to build &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo;.
This post is all about threat modeling the system to identify scenarios for attacks which we will perform in the upcoming posts.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model.
In this post we dive into &amp;ldquo;Operationalizing&amp;rdquo; the model. The scenario is the creation of Husky AI and my experiences and learnings from that.
Part 3 - Operationalizing the Husky AI model This actually took much longer than planned.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post we described the overall machine learning pipeline.
In this post we dive into the technical details on how I built and trained the machine learning model for Husky AI.
After reading this you should have a good understanding around the technical steps involved in building a machine learning system, and also some thoughts around what can be attacked.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post I talked about good resources for learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning in general, and how I started my journey in this space.
The next few posts will be about Husky AI.
What is Husky AI? Husky AI allows a user to upload an image, and get an answer back if the image contains a husky or not.</description>

      <description>This year I have spent a lot of time studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good and useful attacks during operations, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.
This post describes my studying approach, materials, courses, and learnings.</description>
