      <description>This year I have been busy studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good attacks, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.
This post describes my studying approach, materials, courses, and learnings. I thought to share this, in case there are others who are interested to get started in this space but don&amp;rsquo;t how and where.</description>
