      <description>In the previous post I talked about learning resources for AI/ML. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to dive into details on building a model and application we can perform security testing on.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe how I built Husky AI, an application that can identify if an image contains a husky or not.

If you watched the show Silicon Valley, you might find this quite funny.
In particular we will cover the following topics:</description>

      <description>This year I have spent a lot of time studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good and useful attacks during operations, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.
This post describes my studying approach, materials, courses, and learnings.</description>
