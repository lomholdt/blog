      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence. Click on the blog tag &amp;ldquo;huskyai&amp;rdquo; to see all the posts, or visit the overview section.
In the previous post we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model to build &amp;ldquo;Husky AI&amp;rdquo;.
This post is all about threat modeling the system to identify scenarios for attacks which we will perform in the upcoming posts.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post we walked through the steps required to gather training data, build and test a model.
In this post we dive into &amp;ldquo;Operationalizing&amp;rdquo; the model. The scenario is the creation of Husky AI and my experiences and learnings from that.
Part 3 - Operationalizing the Husky AI model This actually took much longer than planned.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post we described the overall machine learning pipeline.
In this post we dive into the technical details on how I built and trained the machine learning model for Husky AI.
After reading this you should have a good understanding around the technical steps involved in building a machine learning system, and also some thoughts around what can be attacked.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
In the previous post I talked about good resources for learning more about artificial intelligence and machine learning in general, and how I started my journey in this space.
The next few posts will be about Husky AI.
What is Husky AI? Husky AI allows a user to upload an image, and get an answer back if the image contains a husky or not.</description>

      <description>This year I have spent a lot of time studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.
To come up with good and useful attacks during operations, I figured it is time to learn the fundamentals and start using software, tools and algorithms. My goal was to build a couple of end to end machine learning systems from scratch, and then attack them.
This post describes my studying approach, materials, courses, and learnings.</description>
