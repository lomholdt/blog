       <h1>McPivot and useful LLDB commands</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Just a list of useful notes when dealing with Macs. I'm pretty new to Macs and there might be other, better solutions
      to the challenges I had to sovle but these worked for me and I'm learning. :)</p>

<h3>Pivoting between accounts and keychain issues</h3>
<p>After pivoting on a target host and elevating to root it seems not possible to gain access to other keychains easily. It 
  requires to know the password of the other account still. Just running security dump-keychain doesn't work over 
  ssh even after su - which kinda makes sense. It also doesn't work when authenticating via public/private key pair as some articles I read suggested - which also makes sense since the keychain is encrypted using the users password afaik.
   One still has to running security unlock-keychain -i and enter the password for it to work It seems that keychain just isn't unlocked over ssh. 
   Overall, this is actually pretty neat and a good defense in dpeth feature, which as I'm learning MacOS has quite a bit.</p>

  <h3>So what to do?</h3>
  <p>Two things came to mind right away:
    <li>(1) Updating ~/.bash_profile to wait for the target to open a new terminal.</li>
    <li>(2) Pivot over to a process of the other target (in their main session with an unlocked keychain) and inject code.</li>
  </p>

  <h3>Inject code into another running process</h3>
  <p>SIP (System Integrety Protection) makes it difficult to debug other process.</p><p>Turning it off requires at least a reboot. 
    The good news is, that its typically not that difficult to find some unsigned binaries running. Turns out that as long as a binary 
    isn't signed (by a certificate that the Mac trusts) debugging that process works just fine. So, you can't debug the Google Chrome process, but 
    you might find something else that is running that you can debug.</p>

    <h4>Attach</h4>
    <li>lldb -n processname</li>
    <li>lldb -p pid</li>

  <h4>Expressions and the McPivot</h4>
  <p>Time to learn about lldb, which I have never used before. Turns out that with expressions one can inject and run code the debugged process. That's straight forward and super simple.
  </p>
  <li>p (void) system("whoami &> /tmp/log.txt")</li><br>
  This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12829665/how-to-call-methods-or-execute-code-in-lldb-debugger"> stackoverflow post here</a> gave me the basic inspiration.
