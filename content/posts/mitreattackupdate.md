MITRE just updated the [ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) to include Cloud TTPs. 

The updated matrix now includes the techniques for stealing cookies from machines and using them for lateral movement. These are the two techniques I helped contribute to the matrix:

* [Credential Access - Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539/)
* [Lateral Movement - Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1506/)

It was exciting experience to collaborate with MITRE and contribute on this. And kinda cool to see the [Pass the Cookie](https://wunderwuzzi23.github.io/blog/passthecookie.html) work referenced.

Cheers!
