Excited to announce that I will be presenting at [BSides Singapore](https://bsidessg.org/speaker/johann-rehberger/) this year.

The topic is adversarial usage of virtual machines during lateral movement. And we will also cover threat hunting and detection ideas. 

I have been referring to this technique as the **Shadowbunny** over the years. :)

The conferences is on September 24th-25th, it will be all virtual and free to attend. Check out the [BSidesSG 2020 website and schedule](https://bsidessg.org) for other talks and details.

Looking forward to see many of you.

Cheers.
