Pass the Cookie made it into the latest 2600 magazine! Very excited about this! 

I was just walking around Capitol Hill and stopped by [Ada's Technical Books](https://www.adasbooks.com/) on 15th Avenue - a great coffee shop with lots of technical books. Right after walking in to grab a cup of tea, I saw the latest Hacker Quaterly. A few months back I submitted an article about "Pass the Cookie", so I had to check, and the article got indeed published!

## How to get it?

Get it in your favorite bookstore or online from the [2600 Online Shop](https://store.2600.com/collections/downloads/products/new-issue-pdf-winter-2019-2020).

This is the cover of the Winter edition (it's pretty easy to spot!):

Hope you'll enjoy reading it, my article is called **"Pass the Cookie and Pivot to the Clouds"**.
