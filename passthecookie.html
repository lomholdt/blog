       <h1>Pivot to the Cloud using Pass the Cookie</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Web Applications and Services use cookies to authenticate sessions and users.</p>
    <p><b>An adversary can pivot from a compromised host to Web Applications and Internet Services by stealing authentication cookies 
       from browsers and related processes. At the same time this technique bypasses most multi-factor authentication protocols.</b><p> The reason for this is that the final authentication token that the attacker steals is issued after all factors have been validated.
       Many users persist cookies that are valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk and also in process memory. Additionally other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication tokens in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). This pivoting technique  can be extended to bearer tokens, JWT and the likes.</p>
    After an adversary acquires a valid cookie they can perform a Pass the Cookie attack to login to the corresponding web application.</p>
<b>So, let's Pass the Cookie and pivot to the clouds. </b><br><br>
<h2>Attack Chain</h2>
<p>
  <i><b>Disclaimer:</b> Always make sure you have proper authorization before pen testing.</i><br><br>
Pass the Cookie is a post-exploitation technique. This means that we have code running on the target machine already and leverage the following steps (variations exist):
<ul>
  <li>Acquire the cookie from the victims browser (e.g. via process dump, or accessing the cookie storage on disk)</li>
  <li>Opening Firefox on the attackers machine (or any other machine)</li>
  <li>Navigate to the resource to aceess (on the domain the cookie is valid for)</li>
  <li>Use the Developer Console and set the authentication token via document.cookie = "stolen cookie", or by using the UI to set cookies</li>
  <li>Refresh the page and observe being logged in as the victim.</li>     
</ul> 
</p>
<br>
<h2>Detections</h2>
    <p>
When it comes to detections a few things come to mind:
    <ul>
    <li>One can monitor on the client side for applications that perform process dumps on browser processes.</li>
   <li>Monitor for unusual activity on critical web assets (like cloud provider management consoles, etc,â€¦)</li>
   <li>Monitor for login anomalies (location, time, unusual access patterns)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<br>
<h2>Mitigations</h2> <p>
To protect from these attacks it's important to stay up to date with security patches, etc. to ensure your host does not get compromised. As seasoned security engineer you assume the worst, and here are some ideas on how to mitigate implications of an attack:
<ul>
   <li>Regularly delete persistent cookies, so they get removed from hard drive to limit exposure.</li>
   <li>Delete session cookies as well</li>
   <li>Browse sensitive sites from isolated machines (e.g. machine used for Facebook should not be the same used for banking,...)</li>
   <li>Requiring further authentication proof for sensitive operations can help limit the damage</li>
   <li>Requiring client side certificates makes it also more difficult to pass the cookie</li>
</ul>
</p>
   <br>
<h2>Aquiring Cookies, Tools and Techniques</h2><p>
    In case you don't won't to write your own toolset, there are a couple of options available to gain access to cookies:
    <ul><li><a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/multiple-os-post-gather-modules/">Access SQL Lite Database of Firefox and Chrome</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/defaultnamehere/cookie_crimes">Neat way to grab cookies on Macs (but also Windows and Linux)</a></li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Pass The Cookie - Cheat Sheet</h2>
   <p>Below is a list of some "cookies of interest" for valuable web applications your organization might use. An adversary might be after those and you could emulate to see if your organization catches the attack. This list might change over time or have inaccuracies - feel to provide feedback or help amend.</p>
    <table class="w3-table w3-bordered w3-striped">
    <tr class="w3-blue-grey">
     <th>Application</th><th>Cookie Name</th><th>Domain</th><th>Notes</th></tr> 
     <tr><td>Hotmail, Calendar, People</td><td>RPSSecAuth</td><td>.live.com</td><td>Access to mail, no OneDrive with these</td></tr> 
     <tr><td>Gmail</td><td>OSID<br>HSID<br>SID<br>SSID</td><td>.google.com</td><td>All four needed. Access to mail (not other google properties yet, needs more debugging)</td></tr> 
     <tr><td>GitHub</td><td>user_session</td><td>.github.com</td><td></td></tr> 
     <tr><td>Amazon Web Services</td><td>aws-userInfo<br>aws-creds</td><td>us-east-2.console<br>.aws.amazon.com</td><td>AWS console</td></tr> 
     <tr><td>Microsoft Online</td><td>ESTSAUTHPERSISTENT</td><td>.microsoftonline.com</td><td></td></tr> 
     <tr><td>Facebook</td><td>c_user<br> xs</td><td>.facebook.com</td><td>need these two.</td></tr>
     <tr><td>OneLogin</td><td>sub_session_onelogin.com</td><td>.onelogin.com</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <i>Notice: When setting multiple cookies there are sometimes differences in how the different browser web console's work. For instance you might have to call document.cookie = "" for each cookie individually (I noticed this in Firefox). You can always view the currently set cookies via document.cookie
    </i></p><br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
    <p>
    Pass the Cookie is a powerful way to pivot from on-premise machines to cloud assets. It can be leveraged to bypass 2FA techniques as the cookie is in the end still a single factor.
  Hope this was helpful, so you can build better detections, improvements and tests into your infrastructure to catch malicious activity.
